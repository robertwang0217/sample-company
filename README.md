# sample-company

1. Installed laravel 5.8, to take advantage of make:auth as required
2. Not sure what server to deploy, so I have set it up locally. I have attached the DB sql file at root, 'laravel.sql'
3. Connect the DB and run 'php artisan serve' to start the project
4. Run 'vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/App/Http/Controllers/CompanyControllerTest' and 'vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/App/Http/Controllers/EmployeeControllerTest', for unit test
